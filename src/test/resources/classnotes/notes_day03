Cucumber BDD Automation Day 03
------------------------------

- write feature files with Scenarios in Gherkin language
- write step definitions for each step in scenario
- add Page object classes with elements and methods
- use a CukesRunner to run the scenarios
- do assertion using JUnit
- use tags to filter the scenarios then execute them
- plugin for html reporting in cukesRunner class

- passing parameters using scenario steps
- Background
- @Before, @After, @BeforeStep , @AfterStep
- Parameterization ...
=================================================

lyft.fare.estimate.url=https://www.lyft.com/rider/fare-estimate

Feature file:
	lyft_fare_estimate.feature

Feature: Searching Lyft fare details

	As a rider , I should be able to enter pickup and drop off locations so that I can see the estimated fare


Scenario: Fare estimate using City
	Given User is on lyft fare estimate page
	When User enters "Mclean, VA" to pickup address
	And User enters "Woodbridge, VA" to drop address
	And User clicks on get estimate button
	Then User should see estimated prices

========

- PASSING PARAMETERS FROM FEATURE FILE:

Lets look at this step below, it has city name within double quotes:

When User enters "Mclean, VA" to pickup address

When we generate a step for above step, Cucumber will look at "Mclean, VA" as a String parameter. So to match it , we need to write our step definition like below:

@When("User enters {string} to pickup address")
public void user_enters_to_pickup_address(String pickUpLocation) {

}

{string} -> means, String parameter. and we can pass different values, not only "Mclean, VA"

EX: When User enters "Brooklyn, NY" to pickup address
When User enters "7925 jones branch dr" to pickup address

public void user_enters_to_pickup_address(String pickUpLocation)==> when we have a parameter coming from cucumber scenario step, our java method in Step def class, needs to have a String parameter. Like String pickUpLocation.

When User enters "Mclean, VA" to pickup address

@When("User enters {string} to pickup address")
public void user_enters_to_pickup_address(String pickUpLocation) {
	//value of pickUpLocation => Mclean, VA
}

----
When User enters "Boston, MA" to pickup address

@When("User enters {string} to pickup address")
public void user_enters_to_pickup_address(String pickUpLocation) {
	//value of pickUpLocation => Boston, MA
}
----

When User enters 155 to amount field

@When("When User enters {int} to amount field")
public void userEntersAmount(int amount) {
	amount ==> 155
}
----
Multiple String parameters from scenario:

When User enters "Boston, MA" to pickup address "New York, NY" to drop-off address

@When("User enters {string} to pickup address {string} to drop-off address")
public void user_enters_to_pickup_address(String pickUpLocation, String dropOffLocation) {
	//value of pickUpLocation => Boston, MA
}
============================

Smoke tests => dev env
			=> QA env
			=> staging
			=> Prod

Regression(at end of each sprint) => dev env
		   => QA env
		   => staging
		   => prod (before release)

if you are running automation in prod, you need dedicated credentials and test data.
=============================

So far:
	- feature files
	- step definition classes
	- dryRun
	- CukesRunner
	- tags @likeThis
	- plugin
	- passing step parameters
		-> passing single param
		-> passing multiple params

When passing parameters, we can pass single value or list of values to the step.

EX: single => When user searches for "java"
	multiple=> When user searches for the following:
					|java|
					|selenium|
					|cucumber bdd|
					|QA automation|

IMPLEMENTATION:
	@When("user searches for {string}")
	public void userSearchesFor(String value) {
		....
	}

	@When("user searches for {string}")
	public void userSearchesFor(List<String> values) {
		....
	}

When passing multiple values, our method parameter will be a list.

Lets try now with following scenario:

google_multiple_search.feature

@google
Feature: Passing multiple parameters to the step

Scenario:
	Given User is on Google home page
	Then User should be able to search for following:
					|java|
					|selenium|
					|cucumber bdd|
					|QA automation|
					|wooden spoon|
============================================

percentage_calculator.feature

percentage.url=https://percentagecalculator.net

Feature: Calculate 5% multiple values

Scenario: User calculating 5% values
	Given User is on percentage calculator page
	Then User should see following calculations:
		|100|5|
		|500|25|
		|1300|65|
		|2100|105|

As you can see above, we are passing multiple values to our step that are in PAIR format. So we can look at it as Key+Value format in the Map data structure.

So while implementing the above step, we can add a Map parameter to our method:

@Then("User should see following calculations:")
public void user_should_see_following_calculations(Map<Integer, Integer> valuesMap) {
    System.out.println("valuesMap = " + valuesMap);
}

Map<Integer, Integer> valuesMap => with follwing values:
First comes the key then the value for that key:
we can have multiple K+V pairs in a map:
|100|5|
|500|25|
|1300|65|
|2100|105|

In the background cucumber framework will create hashmap and add values similar to below:

Map<Integer, Integer> valuesMap = new HashMap<>();
valuesMap.put(100,5);
valuesMap.put(500,25);
valuesMap.put(1300,65);
valuesMap.put(2100,105);

How to read values from a map:

valueMap.get(100) => 5
valueMap.get(500) => 25
...
valueMap.get(2100) => 105
.........................

How to loop through each key in the map:

for(Integer inputKey : valueMap.keySet()) {
	enter inputKey into target number
	click calculate
	read 5% result and compare with inputKey's value in the map:
		valueMap.get(inputKey) => value of the key
}

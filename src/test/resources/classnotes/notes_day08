Excel Automation Basics Day 2
-----------------------------

Jenkins, Selenium Grid ==> Vasyl
SQL + JDBC -> Another Deep Instructor
Rest API Automation -> Me - save some battery for API
Interview Review Bootcamp -> 10 days

Yesterday:
	- Excel Reading using Apache POI library

	-> installed MS Excel
	-> added apache poi dependency to pom.xml
	-> added excel file with data
	-> XLS file -> HSSFWorkbook > HSSFSheet > HSSFRow > HSSFCell
	-> XLSX file -> XSSFWorkbook > XSSFSheet > XSSFRow > XSSFCell

doc -> docx

I use apache POI library to read and write from excel files.

Open Workbook:
	 XSSFWorkbook workbook = new XSSFWorkbook("Employees.xlsx");
In Computer path:
 XSSFWorkbook workbook = new XSSFWorkbook("/Users/cybertekb24/Desktop/Employees.xlsx");

Goto specific worksheet:
	XSSFSheet worksheet = workbook.getSheet("data");

Goto Row 1 and Cell 1:
	System.out.println(worksheet.getRow(1).getCell(1));

	emailElem.sendKeys(worksheet.getRow(1).getCell(1));
===============================

add new class in tests package:
	ExcelReadActions

@Test
public void readExcelSheetData() {

}

=============

Count number of rows:

#1 - getPhysicalNumberOfRows() method
//find out number of rows in the worksheet

int rowsCount = dataSheet.getPhysicalNumberOfRows();
System.out.println("rowsCount = " + rowsCount);

-this method starts counting from 1. and not 0.
-if there are empty rows in between, it will not count them.
- it ignores empty rows
EX:
	row with data
	row with data
	Row with empty
	row with data
Result will be 3. because we have empty row

#2 - getLastRowNum() method:

int usedRowsCount = dataSheet.getLastRowNum();
System.out.println("usedRowsCount = " + usedRowsCount);

- it starts counting from 0
- it counts empty rows as well
- good fit to use with for loop, especially if there are empty rows

	row with data
	Row with empty
	Row with empty
	row with data
It will return 3. since it starts counting from 0.

why toString Murodil? Because dataSheet.getRow(i).getCell(0) doesn't return String?

dataSheet.getRow(i).getCell(0) ==> returns XSSFCell object
if we just print it, it will print as String
but
if we want to compare, we need to toString() first, convert to String object first then check condition

if (dataSheet.getRow(i).getCell(0).toString().equals("Fahima")) {
                System.out.println(dataSheet.getRow(i).getCell(0) +" | "+
                        dataSheet.getRow(i).getCell(0) );
            }

@Murodil if there is an empty cell between rows, it is getting nullpointerexception. How do we handle it?
- we can check if cell is not Null using condition

if (dataSheet.getRow(0).getCell(0) != null)

=========================

HOW TO WRITE INTO EXCEL FILE?

#1 Open the workbook using FileInputputStream

FileInputputStream fis = new FileInputputStream("Employees.xlsx");
XSSFWorkbook workbook = new XSSFWorkbook(fis);

#2 Goto the worksheet
 XSSFSheet sheet = workbook.getSheetAt(0);

#3 if the cell was empty, we need to first create it.
	XSSFCell cell = sheet.getRow(0).createCell(3);

#4 Type the value using setCellValue method:
	cell.setCellValue("Salary");

#5 To save changes, we need to open file using outPutStream:

FileOutputStream outputStream = new FileOutputStream(filePath);
//save/write changes to the workbook
 workbook.write(outputStream);

#6 close streams and workbook. good to do.

outputStream.close();
workbook.close();
in.close();
========================

How to write into excel file ?
I open the workbook and use setCellValue method to write into a cell. Then we save the changes using FileOutPutStream. and worbook.write method.

========================

DDT using Excel:
	Data Driven Test using Excel file:

	We store all credentials/test data into Excel file.
	Then Loop through the data in the excel file and login to vytrack
	if login is successful > we type pass to Result column.
	If login fails > we type fail to Result column

========================
Monday, Tuesday ==> Jan 10 , 11
4 PM -> 6:50 PM EST practice
